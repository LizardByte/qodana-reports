# qodana-reports

This repository contains the reports generated by [Qodana](https://www.jetbrains.com/qodana/) for 
[LizardByte](https://github.com/LizardByte) projects.

## View reports

Reports are available under the https://app.lizardbyte.dev/qodana-reports/ base URL.

Following the base url, the repository name must be added, along with a branch (i.e. `master` or `nightly`) or
PR number (e.g. `88`), and finally the language the report was generated for (e.g. `python`).

An example URL would be: `https://app.lizardbyte.dev/qodana-reports/RetroArcher/nightly/python`

The language names are the same as the ones used by Qodana, but lowercase.
